# 🚀 [Web Application with Kubernetes and Jenkins] 🚀
## ☁️ • vq8-k8s-project • ☁️
#### This project focuses on building and deploying a web application with Kubernetes and Jenkins. The workflow is fully automated using Jenkins for CI/CD, and Kubernetes for container orchestration. The main tasks include:

- 🔢 Create a web page that displays the number of visits (the count should be stored in Redis)

- 🐳 Build and publish a container image with the web page

- 🛠️ Set up a local Kubernetes cluster with Nginx Ingress Controller (Docker Desktop, Minikube)

- 🚀 Deploy the application and all necessary services (including Redis) to the Kubernetes cluster

- 🌐 Configure Ingress for routing traffic

- 🌍 Demonstrate the setup in a web browser and show the resources created in Kubernetes

- 🔄 Automate the process using Jenkins
